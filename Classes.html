        If you've never done martial arts before it can be a bit confusing to know what is what. In order to teach "mixed martial arts"
        we teach a range of martial arts to get a well-rounded "mix". This includes Thai boxing, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Wrestling. You are welcome
        to come to one type of class or all of them. It's up to you. Below is a short explanation of each martial art and each class so you know what
        to expect. However, we encourage you to come to each session at least once to see if it's for you. </p>

    <h2>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</h2>
    <div class="row" style="margin-top:50px">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <img src="MMA_rolling.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%">
        <h5>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, also called ground-work, involves takedowns and submissions. </h5>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
          Our BJJ sessions involve learning a range of techniques that can be used in no-gi BJJ, MMA and self-defence.
          The aim of BJJ is to disable an opponent when on the floor. There are no punches or kicks, just takedowns (putting people on the floor),
          holds (holding a person so they can't move) and submissions (putting a person in a position where they need to submit for their own wellbeing).
          Despite how it sounds, BJJ is incredibly safe and is even safer than most common sports.

    <h2>Thai Boxing</h2>
    <div class="row" style="margin-top:50px">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <img src="MMA_striking.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%">
        <h5>
          Thai Boxing is a striking martial art involving a range of punches, kicks, elbows and knees.
        </h5>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
          Our thai boxing classes are very popular due to being a great way to get fit with a high energy vibe.
          You'll learn effective ways to punch, kick and defend while in a safe atmosphere. If you want to compete you'll
          have the opportunity twice a year, with regular fight camps to get you prepared. However, if you want to take things
          at a more relaxed pace, go ahead. Many of our members come for the good atmosphere, friends, and socials.

    <h2>Wresting</h2>
    <div class="row" style="margin-top:50px">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <img src="Wrestling.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%">
        <h5>
          Wrestling is a grappling martial art involving takedowns, throws, and pins.
        </h5>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
          Our wrestling sessions are a perfect component for practicing MMA or to just learn by itself. The classes are very similar to BJJ but
          with more time spent standing and on your feet than on the floor. During the classes you'll learn how to effectively take an opponent
          from standing to being on the ground, as well as learning the defence.

    <h2>Women and non-binary session</h2>
    <div class="row" style="margin-top:50px">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <img src="MMA_buds.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%">
        <h5>
          The women and non-binary sessions teach mma with an emphasis on self-defence
        </h5>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
          Although we want our club to be as friendly as possible,
          and would love all people to feel comfortable training with all other people,
          we understand that sometime this isn't possible. Some people find training with men,
          who are often much larger and stronger, quite intimidating. The women's and non-binary sessions
          offer a more relaxed environment to train in, as well as focusing on techniques that have applications in self-defense.
